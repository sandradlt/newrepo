New repo for Week 4 assignment 
# Welcome to my Profile ReadMe file! 
My name is **Sandra** and I'm an experienced Marketing and Communications Specialist with a robust background in strategic communication, content creation, and project management. Bilingual in English and Spanish, proficient in AP Style, social media management, and multimedia production. Proven success in enhancing brand awareness and stakeholder engagement. Adept at leading projects, from intranet launches to high-profile events. Committed to delivering cohesive messaging aligned with organizational goals.  


I'm excited to learn more skills including markup and become a _**web developer**_.

Here is what I hope to do when we're done with the second course:
* Create a website for my professional online portofio that I show off during interviews.
* Make edits to existing websites.
* Understand what vendors are referring to better when I work with them on web projects.
