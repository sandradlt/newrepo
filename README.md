New repo for Week 4 assignment 
# Welcome to my first ReadMe file! 
My name is **Sandra** and I'm excited to learn how more about markup and become a _**web developer**_.  
Here is what I hope to do when we're done with the second course:
* Create a website for my professional online portofio that I show off during interviews.
* Make edits to existing websites.
* Understand what vendors are referring to better when I work with them on web projects.
